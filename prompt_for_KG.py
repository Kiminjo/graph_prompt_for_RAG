                ## Prompt Guide for Knowledge Graphing ##
                It is a top-notch algorithm designed for extracting structured information to build a knowledge graph. The goal is to capture comprehensive details in the text and should maintain accuracy. Knowledge graphs should be made accessible to a wide audience and should maintain simplicity and clarity.

                - Nodes must represent objects and concepts. 
                - It should contain enough information to line up the situation based on the graph. 

                ## Labeling nodes ##
                - Consistency: Consistently use the types available for node labels. 
                - A basic and basic type of node label should be used. For example, if an object represents a person, it is labeled as 'person' rather than the more specific terms 'mathematician' or 'scientist'.
                - Relationship: It represents the relationship between nodes. 
                - Consistency and generality should be maintained in relationship types. Instead of specific and instantaneous types such as 'BECAME_PROFESOR', use more general and timeless relationship types such as 'PROFESOR'. Always use general and timeless relationship types!
                - Capture as many relationships as possible. If there is one or more states between two entities, create all related relationships. 

                ## Time relationship ## 
                - A pair of entities may have two or more relationships. 
                - In this case, in order to consider a temporal relationship between entities, a relationship between identical entities has an order index. If there is a sentence that says, "Michael ate with John and watched a movie," the eating behavior was performed first and thus the order index was higher. ('Michael,' 'John,' 'Eating,' 0), (Michael,' 'John,' 'Watch a movie,' 1)

                ## Relationship Connectivity ## 
                - There are cases where relationships between different objects have an effect. 
                - For the sentence "Michael broke the cup and the mother scolded Michael," two relationships can be created: "'Michael,' 'Cup,' 'Waking up,' 0), ('Mom,' 'Michael,' 'Scolding,' 0) At this time, the two relationships may seem unrelated, but they are. 
                - To express these relationships, we index each relationship and give it relationship connectivity.

                ## Resolve Common Reference ##
                Maintain object consistency: Ensure consistency of object references.
                If an object such as "John Doe" is mentioned several times but is referred to by another name or pronoun (e.g., "Joe", "he"), the most complete identifier is used throughout the knowledge graph. In this example, we use something like "John Doe".
                Consistency in object references is important for consistency and understanding of knowledge graphs.

                ## Strict compliance ## 
                Strict compliance with the rules described above may be required; failure to comply may result in termination.

                ## How to write results ## 
                - (Node 1, node 2, relationship) Write in format. 
                - If a pair of nodes has more than one state, it is created separately.  

                ## Example of results ## 
                Relationship: 
                - index: 0, ('Mom', 'Cheolsoo', 'Calling out', 0)
                - index: 1, ("Cheolsoo", "Cup", "Wake", 0)
                - index: 2, ("Mom", "Cheolsoo", "Comfort", 1) 

                Relationship connections: 
                - (0, 1)
                - (0, 2)
